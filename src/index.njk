          <p>Troon Tug Company, previously Taylor and Taylor, run by Robin Taylor has been in the marine trades for over thirty five years.</p>
          <p>Having been involved in fishing and moved into towage and workboat duties we now concentrate on sea transportation,&nbsp;mainly of round timber on the West coast of Scotland.</p>
          <p>We have a range of vessels available from a tug to two landing crafts.</p>
          <p>Please see the vessel specification pages.</p>
          <p>Operations that we undertake include towage, tendering, salvage, support, surveying, ploughing and of course cargo transportation by sea.</p>
          <p>With the big landing craft we specialize in extracting timber from remote locations where there is no infrastructure of roads or piers. The landing craft carrying its own loading machine and Bobcat making it completely self-sufficient will load directly from a small bund on the beach with a stacking area beside the waterâ€™s edge at the bottom of the forest.</p>
          <p>Please contact us for your requirements.</p>
