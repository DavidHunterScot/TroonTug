                    <p>Having been involved in fishing and moved into towage, round timber transportation by sea and workboat duties we now concentrate on sea transportation, to remote areas on the West coast of Scotland.</p>
                    <p>We have a range of vessels available from a tug/workboat to a landing craft.</p>
                    <p>Please see the vessel specification pages.</p>
                    <p>Operations that we undertake include towage, tendering, salvage, support, surveying, and of course cargo transportation by sea.</p>
                    <p>With the landing craft we specialize in transportation of plant and materials to and from remote locations that are otherwise inaccessible. The landing craft carrying its own loading machine and Bobcat making it completely self-sufficient will load directly from a small bund on the beach with a stacking area beside the waterâ€™s edge at the bottom of the forest.</p>
